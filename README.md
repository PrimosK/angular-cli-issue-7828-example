# Demonstrates the issue reported under [angular/angular-cli#7828](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/7828)

This is the example project demonstrating the issue of Angular CLI not reloading changes of external script files.

The Angular CLI used in this project is 1.4.2. which should based on this [comment](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/7828#issuecomment-333604019) resolve the issue but as demonstrated it doesn't.
